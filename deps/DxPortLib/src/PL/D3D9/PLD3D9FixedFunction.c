 * In Direct3D, the equivalent is texture stages.
 * 
 * They're effectively interchangable, so what we do is we support a
 * fixed subset of texenv collections that are basically like shaders.
 * 
 * A sane implementation might include actual shaders in its place, but
 * not quite that far in yet.
 * 
 * Do not use Presets _and_ Shaders at the same time.
 * 
 * Most of the stuff here is DxLib only so if you don't build for DxLib
 * you don't need it.
